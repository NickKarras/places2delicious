places2delicious
----------------

* Working again: query fixed and require_relative for "Bookmark".
* Tested with Ruby 2.1.3

Anyway, who needs to upload their Firefox bookmarks to Delicious?
You should all be using Pinboard.in!

----------------

This Ruby script exports bookmarks from Firefox >3.x places.sqlite to Delicious.

The YAML places2delicious.yml property file must be updated with:
- the full path to your Firefox places database file
- your Delicious username and password.

You may specify a specific tag to import when calling the Ruby script.

./places2delicious.rb tag
